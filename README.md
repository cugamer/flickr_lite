Flickr Lite
===========

This is a solo project from my first run through of Dev Bootamp phase two.  Essentially it's a photo upload and management application.  Built over a two day period, it allows the user to uplad photos, create seperate albums, view other user's albums and comment.

The application is built in Sinatra using a basic skeleton created by DBC.  Due to this it is only supported on MacOS X. It's a CRUD app in most respects but it does support file uploads.  Commenting and user sessions are fully AJAXed.
